thorium is a fabric mod that fixes 50+ small bugs and annoyances in Minecraft, without affecting gameplay mechanics.
Check out [this list](FIXED_ISSUES.md) to view all issues thorium fixes!

Because thorium does not affect gameplay mechanics, it is not a hard requirement to have installed on the client or the
server when joining a server.
However, we still recommend installing it on both, since not all issues can be fixed on the server (or client) side.

If you have encountered an issue or would like to request a fix for a Minecraft bug, please create an issue on
our [issue tracker](https://github.com/PotassiumMC/thorium/issues/new/choose).
